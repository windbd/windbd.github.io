  Thanks for your interest in working with us! I will join <a href="https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/">ISTD</a> @ <a href="https://www.sutd.edu.sg/">SUTD</a> in early 2025. I am actively looking for highly motivated PhD students (2025 Fall batch) and Visiting students.

  
  <h3><a name="bio"></a>Readme</h3>
  
  Here are some general information you might want to know:
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>About Me</strong>: I obtained my PhD from The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) then joined Alibaba DAMO Academy (达摩院) Singapore with the Alistar Award (阿里星). I have both academic (e.g., analysing LLMs) and industry experience (e.g., training LLMs). A short bio is <a href="./bio.html">here</a> and you can get to know more about me from <a href="https://isakzhang.github.io/index.html">my homepage</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>About SUTD</strong>: SUTD is Singapore's fourth public university established in collaboration with MIT. Though relatively young, its NLP area ranks <strong>No. 41</strong> around the world and <strong>No.16</strong> in Asia (according to CSRanking). I also suggest you checking out where the recent (AI-related) PhD graduates are working now - it's a great indicator if you are considering the PhD program in SUTD :)</li>
    <li><strong>Research directions</strong>: My current research centers on NLP & LLMs, with some specific <a href="https://isakzhang.github.io/index.html">focus areas</a> listed on my main page. While it's great if your interests align with mine, I welcome students from diverse backgrounds working on topics they're passionate about. Feel free to discuss your vision with me.</li>
    <li><strong>Mentoring</strong>: I have mentored students from various background - those without any / with few / with rich research experience, and undergraduate / Master / PhD students. Most of the students publish papers at top conferences and journals with me, and some as their first research papers. You can check out my <a href="isakzhang.github.io/research.html">publication page</a> for details.</li>

  </ul>

  <h3><a name="teaching"></a>Currently Openings (Updated on mid Jan, 2025)</h3>
